        <h2>Short content</h2>
        <p>The novel features the murder of an American heiress on Le Train Bleu, the titular "Blue Train". The novel's
            heroine, Katherine Grey, comes from the fictional village of St Mary Mead, which just happens to be the name
            of the hometown of Agatha Christie's second most famous crime-solving sleuth, Jane Marple, whose character
            was introduced after this novel was published.
            Poirot boards Le Train Bleu, bound for the French Riviera. So does Katherine Grey, who is having her first
            winter out of England, after recently receiving a relatively large inheritance. On board the train Grey
            meets Ruth Kettering, an American heiress leaving her unhappy marriage to meet her lover. The next morning,
            though, Ruth is found dead in her compartment, a victim of strangulation.
            The famous ruby, "Heart of Fire", which had recently been given to Ruth by her father, is discovered to be
            missing. Ruth's father, the American millionaire Rufus Van Aldin, and his secretary, Major Knighton,
            persuade Poirot to take on the case. Ruth's maid, Ada Mason, says that she saw a man in Ruth's compartment
            but could not see who he was. The police suspect that Ruth's lover, the Comte de la Roche, killed her and
            stole the ruby, but Poirot does not think that the Comte is guilty. He is suspicious of Ruth's husband,
            Derek Kettering, who was on the same train but claims not to have seen Ruth. Katherine says that she saw
            Derek enter Ruth's compartment. Further suspicion is thrown on Derek when a cigarette case with the letter
            "K" is found there.
            Poirot investigates and finds out that the murder and the jewel theft might not be connected, as the famous
            jewel thief "The Marquis" is connected to the crime. Eventually, the avaricious Mirelle, who was on the
            train with Derek -- with whom she had been having an affair but, now spurned, is seeking revenge against him
            -- tells Poirot she saw Derek leave Ruth's compartment around the time the murder would have taken place.
            Derek is then arrested. Everyone is convinced the case is solved, but Poirot is not sure. He does more
            investigating and learns more information, talking to his friends and to Katherine, eventually coming to the
            truth.
